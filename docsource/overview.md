## Overview

The Akamai Certificate Provisioning System (CPS) Universal Orchestrator extension is designed to facilitate the management of SSL/TLS certificates on the Akamai platform through Keyfactor Command. Akamai CPS allows users to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates across Akamai's global content delivery network (CDN). This ensures secure and reliable communication for websites and applications by enabling HTTPS.

The orchestrator extension operates using the concept of Certificate Stores. A Certificate Store represents a collection or individual instance of certificates in the Akamai system. These stores can be configured for different environments, such as 'Production' or 'Staging', to better manage the deployment lifecycle of certificates. By utilizing the Akamai CPS Universal Orchestrator extension, administrators can automate inventory, addition, removal, and discovery of certificates, streamlining certificate lifecycle management within the Keyfactor Command platform.
